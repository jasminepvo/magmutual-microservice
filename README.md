Based on a CSV of user information; I built the following endpoints and displayed them in a simple UI:

- Return a specific user (and all associated information): ` GET /user`
- Return a list of users created between a date range:
  `GET /getAllUsersByDateRange `
- Return a list of users based on a specific profession:
  `GET /getAllUsersByProfession `
- Return a list of users based on specific country:
  `GET /getAllUsersByCountry `
