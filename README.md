# MagMutual Microservice

Microservices are great for replacing older monolithic systems.

Based on a CSV of user information; I built the following endpoints and displayed them in a simple UI:

- Return a specific user (and all associated information): ` GET /api/user`
- Return a list of users created between a date range
  `GET api/user-date `
- Return a list of users based on a specific profession
  `GET api/user-profession `
- Return a list of users based on specific country
  `GET api/user-country `
