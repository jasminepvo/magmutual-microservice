# MagMutual Microservice

Microservices are great for replacing older monolithic systems.

Based on a CSV of user information; I built the following endpoints and displayed them in a simple UI:

- Endpoint to return a specific user (and all associated information)
  `/user`
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range
  `/user-date `
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession
  `/user-profession `
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on specific country
  `/user-country `
